## My Pet Store Analysis Project 🐾

**Objective:** Create a system to track and analyze Pet Store Database using SQL and PowerBi.

## What to do 👩‍💻

<ul>
<li><strong> Collect and store pet store data.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Analyze data to find trends and patterns.</strong></li>
<li><strong> Create charts to visualize the data.</strong><</li>
</ul>


## Work process 🗂️

Firstly, I created a database to store my pet shop data and then I thought of an optimal structure for it. I decided to have four tables. The first table, "products," stores information about the products sold in the pet shop. The second table, "customers," contains details about the customers. The third table, "suppliers," holds information about the suppliers that provide products to the pet shop. The fourth table, "sales," tracks the sales transactions.

Secondly, I inserted some generated data into the tables using SQL queries.

Lastly, I conducted an analysis using Power BI to gain insights into the sales data of the pet shop. I started by counting the total amount of sales and then created parameters to explore sales by category and the total number of items sold. Additionally, I implemented a slider to filter and find statistics about sales for particular price ranges. Also I created matrix to see sales tendencies by product name. This analysis revealed detailed trends, such as the popularity of certain product categories and the impact of price on sales volumes.
